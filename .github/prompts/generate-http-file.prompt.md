Create a new http file that contains test requests for the API described in the OpenAPI file.

Use the HostAddress in the existing http file.

The test requests should cover all endpoints, methods, and parameters defined in the OpenAPI file.

The test requests should be designed to test the API's error handling capabilities. They should include a variety of scenarios, such as:
- Invalid input formats
- Missing required fields
- Exceeding maximum field lengths
- Invalid data types
- Boundary values
